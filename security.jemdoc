-- Open it in a hex editor, you will find the flag encoded in Base64 at the end

-- Running strings gave away the answer here

-- I spent some time initially looking at the conversation through wireshark. Looking at the BZ signature, I realised there might be some bzip2 files sent over the network(Later came to know about binwalk which extracts all of the files in a snap). I extracted them and found that the size of flag file is 14 and also came to know the TTH value. So, I realised the flag can be recovered with just a brute-force over all possible strings of 4 length size (BITSCTF{} has 9 bytes and one for the new line char). Unfortunately, we couldn't solve this in the competetion as we couldn't find a reliable TTH calculator. I tried using the tiger module in python with no success :( (*Later*: Investiage more on why this is happening)
-- Yep! tiger and TTH are different [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25962736/python-tiger-hash-values-are-wrong SO-link](look at one of the comments). Looks like TTH uses the tiger message digest and does some more other stuff. Here are some tools used by other teams - rhash, [http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Tthsum tthsum]
